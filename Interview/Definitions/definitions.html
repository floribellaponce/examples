	<h3> #1 PHP - What is the difference between Inheritance and Composition?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Inheritance is the mechanism of basing a object or class upion another object or class,
		retaining a class inherits fields and methods from all its superclasses, whether direct or indirect.
		Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.
		Example: A car is a Vehicle. A vehicle is the parent class/object. The car is the child class/object.
	</p>
	<p> Composition is the mechanism to reuse code across classes by containing instances of
	other classes that implement the desired functionality. A composition establishes a "has-a"
	relationship between classes. Example: A book has a author. A author is its own class/object. A book is its own class/object
		and includes information from the author class/object.  </p>

	<h3> #2 HTML - Difference between Id and Name attributes in HTML .
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The Id must be unique. The Id manipulates the element
		with the specific id. The name attribute specifies a name for the element. A name is used when sending
		data in a form. The difference would be the id manipulates the element and the name references the element.
