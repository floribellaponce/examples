	<h3> #1 PHP - What is the difference between Inheritance and Composition?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Inheritance is the mechanism of basing a object or class upion another object or class,
		retaining a class inherits fields and methods from all its superclasses, whether direct or indirect.
		Inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.
		Example: A car is a Vehicle. A vehicle is the parent class/object. The car is the child class/object.
	</p>
	<p> Composition is the mechanism to reuse code across classes by containing instances of
	other classes that implement the desired functionality. A composition establishes a "has-a"
	relationship between classes. Example: A book has a author. A author is its own class/object. A book is its own class/object
		and includes information from the author class/object.  </p>

	<h3> #2 HTML - Difference between Id and Name attributes in HTML .
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The Id must be unique. The Id manipulates the element
		with the specific id. The name attribute specifies a name for the element. A name is used when sending
		data in a form. The difference would be the id manipulates the element and the name references the element.

<h3>
	#3 JS - Asynchronous behaviors in JavaScript, what does that mean, how is it happening, what are callbacks?
</h3>
	<p>
		Asynchronous means the engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started,
		and the code keeps running without blocking for the result. When the response is ready, an interrupt is fired,
		which causes an event handler to be run, where the control flow continues. The callback points to a function
		that will be executed once the result is ready.
